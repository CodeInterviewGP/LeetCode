            Given an array of words (i.e. ["ABCW", "BAZ", "FOO", "BAR", "XTFN", "ABCDEF"]),
            find the max value of length(s) * length(t), where s and t are words from the array.

            The catch here is that the two words cannot share any characters.

            "ABCW" and "ABCDEF" do not work since they share similar characters.


            for exampe : 
            input ["ABCW", "BAZ", "FOO", "BAR", "XTFN", "ABCDEF"]
                output 4 * 4 = 12 (ABCW , XTFN) (because ABCW and ABCDEF existing the same character, so the result is
                NOT 4 * 6)
        */
    }
}
