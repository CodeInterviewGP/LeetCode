and nut, and return 0, (if bolt and nut match), 1 (bolt is bigger than nut), -1 (bolt is smaller than nut). 
Write a function to find out all matches

2. There are M by N matrix, each cell represent a room, (some rooms mark as locked which means no body can get in).
some rooms have guard inside it, guard can go to any room except locked room, guard can only move up/down/left/right, no diangle.
find out minimum steps guard can reach for each room. e.g. room# 1 takes gurard#1 3 steps to reach there, but it takes guard#2 2steps to get
